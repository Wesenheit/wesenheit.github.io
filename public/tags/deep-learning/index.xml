      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of many classical tasks of machine learning is clustering, based on the data one would like to distinguish some clusters.&#xA;There are many classical approaches to clustering, the most notable ones include: K-means, GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model) trained with the EM algorithm, and DBSCAN.&#xA;While each of those algorithms is widely used in research and industry,&#xA;all of them try to cluster the data using its original representation and mostly fail in the case of hidden similarity between observations.\&#xA;In this post, I present a GMM+VAE deep learning architecture, which will be used to cluster the data based on a learned embedding of the data.&#xA;The clustering model is based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02648&#34;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;, while application to RNA sequencing data is based on the work that I performed during my studies at the Warsaw University.&#xA;The original project with a solution can be found in a related &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Wesenheit/SAD2-22W/tree/main/Project1&#34;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;The dataset used in the study was taken from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://openproblems.bio/competitions/neurips_2021/&#34;&gt;NeuroIPS 2021&lt;/a&gt; competition. In this blog, we will tackle the joint&#xA;embedding part of the competition. We will try to embed biological information in an unsupervised manner and at the same time reduce the impact of batch effect on&#xA;the model performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

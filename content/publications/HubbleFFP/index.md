Are free-floating planets really free-floating or bound on wider orbits?

<!--more-->

<!--
# Introduction

Free-floating planet candidates are a hot-topic in current Astrophysical research. It is widely known that there are several 
plant candidates orbiting around various stellar objects. However, we also know that there is a new class of objects 
called free-floating plantes - planets roaming the univers without any stellar companions. Microlensing is an ideal technique 
that can be used to look for such plantes. However, there is a fundamental problem with such studies. In principle, it is impossible 
to find out if the object is free-floating or orbiting a star on wide orbit. Orbit does not need to be really huge, it is known 
that Neptune orbiting the Sun would be impossible to distinguis from free-floating Neptune-mass object when viewed from certain 
angle. So how do we distinguis those cases?

My name is Mateusz Kapusta, I am currently a student at the Warsaw University, Faculty of Physics. Most of my scientific life was centered around 
the software development for various scientific tasks. Most of my work is possible due to strong mathematics foundations developed at my high school, paired
with substential training in Math/CS as a part of the Collage of Interdisciplinary Studies at the University of Warsaw.

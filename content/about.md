I am a physics/CS student at the University of Warsaw. My scientific career has been
largely focused on developing software for a variety of scientific tasks, primarily in Bayesian modeling and High-Performance Computing (HPC).

In high school, I competed in several scientific Olympiads, where I had the honor of
representing my country at the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics.
Today, I remain committed to this beautiful Olympic tradition and serve as a judge
in various competitions.

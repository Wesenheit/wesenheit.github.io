My name is Mateusz Kapusta, I am a physicist and a software engineer with a
passion for applying Machine Learning, Bayesian modeling, and High-Performance Computing to natural sciences. 
This webpage contains various content that I considered interesting enough to share with the world.
You can find here my [publications](/publications/) and [blog posts](/posts/).
